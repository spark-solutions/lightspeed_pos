# Lightspeed POS

An _unofficial_ gem for interacting with [Lightspeed's Point of Sale API](http://www.lightspeedpos.com/retail/help/developers/api/basics/), ([documentation](http://cloud-docs.lightspeedapp.com/API/APIHelp.help)).

Not all endpoints are implemented yet, but you can help by submitting pull requests!

## Getting Started

First, intialize a new client:

```ruby
client = Lightspeed::Client.new(oauth_token_holder: yourOAuthAwareObjectHere)
```

`yourOAuthAwareObjectHere` must be an object that responds to `oauth_token` and `refresh_oauth_token`. `oauth_token` must return an access token, and `refresh_oauth_token` must handle the refreshing of expired access tokens, so that a subsequent call to `oauth_token` will return a new, unexpired access token.

Next, make a request for your accounts:

```ruby
accounts = client.accounts.all
```

Pick the account you want to use, and then start using it:

```ruby
account = accounts.first
account.items.first
```

## Resources

resources share a common API. Resources that are currently supported by this library are:

* Accounts
* Categories
* Employees
* Items
* Item Matrices
* Item Attribute Sets
* Images
* Inventories
* Orders
* OrderLines
* Sales
* Shops
* Special Orders
* TransferItems
* Transfers
* Vendors

To work with account resources, you first need to fetch an account. The examples below are for items, but will also work with other types listed above.

### List

You can fetch a list of items with this:

```ruby
account.items.all
```

You can pass query parameters to this by using the `params` keyword:

```ruby
account.items.all(params: { itemMatrixID: 0 })
```

You can enumerate over a group of 100 resources at a time (the max in a single request) using `each_page`

```ruby
account.items.each_page! do |items|
  # ItemImporter.import(items)
end
```

Or enumerate over each resource using #each (this still only does a request for each 100 items)

```ruby
account.items.each do |item|
  # ItemImporter.import(item)
end
```

### Show

You can fetch a particular item by its ID by doing this:

```ruby
account.items.find(1)
```
If item with id of `1` is not there, this will raise `Lightspeed::Error::NotFound`

You can fetch the first item using `first`
```ruby
account.items.first
```

### Create

You can create a particular item by calling `create`:

```ruby
account.items.create(description: "Onesie")
```

### Update

You can update a particular item by calling `update`, passing that item's ID and providing a list of attributes to update:

```ruby
account.items.update(1, description: "Onesie")
# OR
account.items.find(1)
item.update(description: "Onesie")
```

### Destroy

You can destroy a particular item by calling `destroy` and passing that item's ID:

```ruby
account.images.destroy(1)
# OR
account.images.find(1)
item.destroy
```

For the `Item` resource, `destroy` is aliased to `archive`:

### TransferItems

Since this module needs extra param to work properly, here's a short guide how to use it:

* Get all TransferItems for specific transfer:
```ruby
account.transfer_items.all( transferID: 3 )
```

* Get single TransferItem for specific transfer:
```ruby
account.transfer_items.first( transferID: 3 )
# OR
account.transfer_items.find( transferID: 3, transferItemID: 1 )
```

* Create TransferItems for specific transfer:
```ruby
account.transfer_items.create(transferID: 4, TransferItem: [{toSend: 10, itemID: 40697}])
```

* Update TransferItems for specific transfer:
```ruby
account.transfer_items.update(transferID: 4, TransferItem: [{toSend: 10, itemID: 40697}])
```

* Delete TransferItems for specific transfer:
```ruby
account.transfer_items.destroy(transferID: 4, TransferItem: [{itemID: 40697}])
```

## Rate Limiting

This gem respects the `X-LS-API-Bucket-Level` header by pausing before a request that would otherwise overrun the API rate limit. It calls `Kernel.sleep` with the minimum number of seconds needed to avoid hitting the limit, which suspends the current thread during that time. If you need to make API calls across multiple Lightspeed accounts using this gem, its recommended to make requests against each account in a separate thread.
